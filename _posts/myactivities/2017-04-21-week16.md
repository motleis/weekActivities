## Passed a Data Science course

I started the week with a new plan and decided to follow a coursera specialisation in data science from Johns-Hopkins University.
Later during the week I decided to take an additional specialisation at the same time 'Genomic Data Science' from Johns-Hopkins University as well.

By the end of the week I were able to successfully finish the first course from the 'Data science' specialisation with full grades. That cousre is the 'Data Scientist Toolbox' course.
I also started two new courses one from each specialisation:
 * R programming
 * Introduction to Genomics

Regarding job hunting,
I decided to focus on two positions. One is a Data Analyst position, which I had an interview for during the week.
I had a very nice interview and was relaxed talking with two nice young researchers.
I do have all the required skills for the position and it would be very nice to pursue that job.
There are 3 other candidates and I am expecting to hear from the interviewers by the end of next week.

The second position is just a post-doc position I applied for. It is a position that I would like to have badly.
Sometimes I feel that such things are 'so good to be true', but in my stubborn nature, I will keep chasing my dreams!
