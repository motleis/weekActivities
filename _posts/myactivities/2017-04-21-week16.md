## Started specialisation courses in Data Science and Genomic Data Science 

I started the week with a new plan and decided to follow a coursera specialisation in data science from Johns-Hopkins University.
Later during the week I decided to take an additional specialisation at the same time 'Genomic Data Science' from Johns-Hopkins University as well.

By the end of the week I were able to successfully finish the first course from the 'Data science' specialisation with full grades. That cousre is the 'Data Scientist Toolbox' course.
I also started two new courses one from each specialisation:
 * R programming
 * Introduction to Genomics
