## A number of interviews
Aftering finishing my contract at a software company in Amsterdam. 
I was happy to leave my programming job because the settings and working environment was not a fit for me.
I was also happy with the humble experience I gained in JSP, Javascripts, Docker, SQL, JIRA, Jenkins, etc... during the six months that I spent working there.

I started with a lot of energy and motivation to land my next dream job.
I contacted my recruiter who quickly arranged a number of interviews for the coming weeks in February.
All of these interviews were not my ideal job, but I showed a lot of enthusism and motivation to work and learn the new skills required for the new job. However, all interviewers were skeptical about the lack of new skills that I did not have as Cloud computing, advanced C and Python experience, and one interviewer claimed that I have no Java experience without assessing my skills!
