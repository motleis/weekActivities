## Experience With DELPHI and RAD Studio
This week I experminted with DELPHI. I setup VirtualBox on my Mac, installed Windows 10, installed RAD studio and developed my first multi-platform tabbed application!

I also completed successfully a java challenge.
The challenge was to compress a String where repeated characters are replaced with the number of repetitions.
