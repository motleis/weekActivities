## Experience With DELPHI and RAD Studio
This week I had a Skype interview for a position that required programming experience in DELPHI.
Having no such experience but liking the company and the position, I showed my enthusisam to learn the language and were invited for an interview in Brussels! I accepted the invitation and started to learn the DELPHI programming already.
I setup VirtualBox on my Mac, installed Windows 10, installed RAD studio and developed my first multi-platform tabbed application!
Unfortunately the interview was cancelled and the position was offered to another candidate with relevant experience. 
Nevertheless, I enjoyed learning getting hands on experience on setting up the environment for DELPHI programming and code my first application in DELPHI.

## Joining Job-Hunting Website and Completed a Challenge 
This week I also joined a Job-Hunting Website.
Filled my profile and accepted a coding challenge.
The challenge was a 1 hour test to code a solution in Java.
The challenge was to compress a String where repeated characters are replaced with the number of repetitions.
I passed the challenge successfully!
One day I will add the JUnit Tests and push the code into github!
