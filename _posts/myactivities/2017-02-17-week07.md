## TicTacToe game
I had an interview at a company that develops desktop applications in java. 
They asked me to develop an algorithm to win in a TicTacToe game.
I enjoyed developing the algorithm and testing it against the test cases they already have.
Then I were invited for an interview. I enjoyed the interview as it was with very professional people.
I did well in the technical part of the interview but I were not a fit to the profile and culture of the company.
