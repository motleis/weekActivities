## Proposing a Solution for Fast/Cheap/Efficient DNA data storage!
I participated in a workshop and worked with a great team of four other people where we proposed a solution for a fast/cheap and efficient DNA read/write system.
It was a great life experience with an amazing team from all over Europe. 
Our work was very interesting and we are currently working on a review paper together!
